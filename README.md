## What is google-book-search?

A Full-Stack web application (created via create-react-app) that allows the user to search the Google Books API for a book title that they want. This returns a thumbnail of the book cover, a link to the actual Google Books search result for that specific book, and also has a button for adding that book for a Favorites system.

The user's Favorites are stored on a (MongoDB) server that persists between page Refreshes. The user is then able to delete books from the Favorites List, at which point the DOM is rendered to update that view.
